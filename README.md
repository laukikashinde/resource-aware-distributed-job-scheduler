## Overview

The **Distributed Task Orchestrator** is a system that intelligently distributes computational tasks across a fleet of worker nodes. Workers register with their hardware specifications (CPU cores, RAM), and tasks specify resource requirements. The system matches tasks to capable workers, tracks resource allocation, and automatically recovers from failures.

**Real-world analogy:** Like Kubernetes for task scheduling, but simpler and purpose-built for understanding distributed systems concepts.

## Features

### Core Features

| Feature                       | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Worker Registration**       | Workers self-register with random CPU/RAM specs          |
| **Resource-Aware Scheduling** | Tasks assigned only to workers with sufficient resources |
| **Task Lifecycle Management** | Complete tracking: pending → running → completed/failed  |
| **Priority Queue**            | Higher priority tasks processed first (integer priority) |
| **Rate Limiting**             | Protection against excessive API requests using SlowAPI  |

### Fault Tolerance

| Feature                   | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heartbeat Monitoring**  | Workers send heartbeats every 5 seconds                          |
| **Dead Worker Detection** | Workers missing heartbeat for 30 seconds are marked dead         |
| **Task Recovery**         | Stuck tasks (>30s) are reset and retried (max 3 attempts)        |
| **Resource Cleanup**      | Resources freed on completion, failure, timeout, or worker death |
| **Atomic Transactions**   | MongoDB transactions prevent race conditions in task assignment  |

---

## System Architecture

The system consists of:

- **API Server** (FastAPI) — Handles task submission and worker communication
- **MongoDB** (Replica Set) — Stores tasks and worker state with transaction support
- **Worker Nodes** — Execute tasks, each with independent heartbeat thread
- **Background Services** — Recovery daemon and heartbeat monitor for fault tolerance

## How It Works

### Task Lifecycle

Tasks progress through four distinct states:

- **Submit** — Client submits task with CPU/RAM requirements and optional priority value
- **Pending** — Task enters queue, waiting for a worker with sufficient available resources
- **Running** — Worker claims task; system atomically allocates resources and locks them
- **Completed/Failed** — Worker reports final status; system releases allocated resources

### Task Assignment

Workers pull tasks rather than being pushed, using a race-free atomic process:

1. Worker requests a task via `GET /tasks/get_task` with its worker ID
2. System finds highest priority pending task matching worker's available CPU and RAM
3. MongoDB transaction atomically updates task status and decrements worker resources
4. If worker's resources change before allocation, transaction aborts and worker retries
5. Successful allocation returns task to worker with allocated resources recorded

### Resource Management

- Each worker tracks total capacity and currently available resources
- Tasks specify required CPU cores and RAM in MB
- Resources are allocated at task start and freed upon completion or failure
- Dead workers have their orphaned tasks recovered and resources released

### Fault Tolerance

- **Heartbeat system** — Workers send heartbeats every 5 seconds; missing 3 consecutive heartbeats marks worker as dead
- **Task timeout** — Tasks running longer than 30 seconds are automatically reset and retried
- **Retry mechanism** — Failed tasks retry up to 3 times before being marked as permanently failed
- **Resource cleanup** — Background processes automatically free resources from dead workers and timed-out tasks

### Priority System

- Tasks include an integer priority field (higher numbers = higher priority)
- When multiple tasks are pending, the system selects the highest priority task
- For tasks with equal priority, older tasks (by creation time) are selected first
- Priority ensures critical tasks skip the queue without starving lower priority tasks

## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Transaction Error

```
Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos
```

**Solution:** Start MongoDB with replica set:

```bash
mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath /data/db
mongosh
rs.initiate()
```

### Rate Limit Hit

```
429 Too Many Requests
```

**Solution:** Wait a few seconds or adjust limits in `routers/task.py` and `routers/workers.py`

### Worker Not Getting Tasks

- Check if workers are registered: `curl http://localhost:8000/workers/get_workers`
- Check if any tasks match worker resources
- Verify heartbeat monitor and recovery daemon are running
- Check MongoDB transaction support is properly configured

### Task Stuck in Running State

- Verify recovery daemon is running
- Check task timeout configuration in `config/constants.py`
- Monitor logs for recovery daemon activity
